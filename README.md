# lf-browser 
This is supposed to be a **L**ight and **F**ast console based Webbrowser.  
I made it in C, using the libraries curl(to get the html body) and curses(To provide a nice interface).  
The name will surely change later.

## Current status
The only thing this program can do is downloading HTML code from a given
URL and removing the whitespaces in front of every line.
